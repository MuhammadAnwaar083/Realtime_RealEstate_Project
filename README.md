# Realtime_RealEstate_Project
 
Real-Time Real Estate Project
Introduction
In this project, an end-to-end data engineering solution was executed to handle real-time real estate data using Apache Kafka. The aim was to build a robust data pipeline capable of processing and storing real estate transaction data in real-time. A variety of technologies, including Python, Amazon Web Services (AWS), Apache Kafka, AWS Glue, Athena, and EC2, were utilized in the development of the pipeline.

This project demonstrates a comprehensive approach to handling data engineering tasks, such as integrating real-time data streams, storing data efficiently, processing it, and enabling easy querying. Kafka was used for real-time message streaming, AWS S3 served as the data lake for storage, Glue was responsible for cataloging and processing the data, and Athena was employed for querying the stored data.

AWS S3: Raw and processed data was stored in S3 as the data lake.
AWS Glue: Data was extracted, transformed, and loaded (ETL) using AWS Glue, and the datasets were cataloged for easy access.
AWS Athena: Serverless queries were run on the data stored in S3 using Athena, allowing SQL-based querying.
EC2 Instances: EC2 instances were utilized for running various data processing tasks and managing the infrastructure.
Technology Stack
The following technologies and tools were employed in the development and deployment of the data pipeline:

Programming Language: Python

Python was used for data processing, Kafka integration, and automation of various tasks in the data pipeline.
Amazon Web Services (AWS)

AWS services provided the scalable and reliable infrastructure needed for data storage, processing, and querying.
S3 (Simple Storage Service)

AWS S3 was used as the data lake for storing raw and processed real estate data securely and at scale.
Athena

Queries were executed on the data stored in S3 using AWS Athena, a serverless query service that allowed SQL-based analysis without moving data to a traditional database.
Glue Crawler

AWS Glue Crawlers were used to automatically discover and catalog datasets stored in S3, making them queryable in Athena.
Glue Catalog

The Glue Catalog maintained metadata for the datasets, ensuring easy access and management of data across different tools.
EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)

EC2 instances were used for running data processing scripts and managing Kafka producers/consumers.
Apache Kafka

Apache Kafka was used to stream real estate transaction data in real-time, providing high throughput, fault tolerance, and scalability.
Dataset Used
A publicly available real estate transaction dataset was used in this project. The main focus was on the operations side of data engineering, specifically building the data pipeline for real-time data processing, rather than the content of the dataset itself. Key operations included:

Data Ingestion: Real-time data was ingested into Kafka from various sources.
Data Storage: Raw and processed data was stored in AWS S3.
Data Transformation and Processing: AWS Glue was used to process and transform the data before it was stored in S3.
Data Querying: AWS Athena was used to query the data directly from S3 using SQL.
The project highlights the development of an end-to-end data pipeline for handling real-time data, showcasing the integration of modern tools and cloud technologies to process and analyze data effectively.

Key Takeaways
Hands-on experience was gained in integrating and automating real-time data streams, transformation, and querying processes.
Insights were gained into building scalable data pipelines capable of processing large volumes of real-time data.
The project demonstrated the use of Python to orchestrate various AWS services and Kafka for data streaming, solidifying key skills in data engineering.
